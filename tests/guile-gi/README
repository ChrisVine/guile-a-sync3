The tests in this directory are not run recursively by 'make test'
executed in the top level directory, because that would make running
those tests dependent on guile-gi, which is an optional dependency
which is not pre-compiled.  Instead, to run the guile-gi tests you
must change to this directory and run 'make test'.
