Overview
--------

This library provides a thread safe event loop for guile-2.2
(event-loop.scm) with support for watches on ports/file descriptors
and timeouts, and which permits events to be posted by other tasks.
This includes tasks running on other threads.

It also provides a coroutines interface (coroutines.scm) which
provides await semantics on such events, so as to avoid inversion of
control (aka "callback hell"), and provision for using these in
conjunction with guile-2.2's suspendable ports (await-ports.scm).

See the documentation mentioned below for further details, and the
docs/example.scm and docs/example-glib.scm files.

A separate guile-a-sync library is available for guile-2.0 here:
https://github.com/ChrisVine/guile-a-sync .  This library and
guile-a-sync for guile-2.0 are parallel installable.

Installation
------------

When first run from git, or a tarball obtained from github, it is
necessary to set up autotools.  This can be done with:

  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr

or on a 64-bit system, probably:

  /autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

This generates a configure script and installs libtool.  Subsequent
configuration can be done just with

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

and

  ./configure --prefix=/usr --libdir=/usr/lib64

respectively.

On a 64 bit system you may also need to include -fPIC in your CFLAGS
options if libtool doesn't do that for you (libtool normally does when
necessary).

After compiling, install with 'make install' as root.

The code in the (a-sync gnome-glib) module has not yet been tested, as
guile-2.2 does not at the time of writing support guile gnome.

There is a bug in how guile-2.1.4 deals with compiled code for files
in a path given by the GUILE_LOAD_PATH environmental variable, which
means that it is not possible to run the tests with 'make test' using
the locally compiled code in the source directory.  Instead it is
necessary to install guile-a-sync2 first and run 'make test' after
installation.

Documentation
-------------

Html documentation is available after installation in the default html
directory for the target installation (normally at
$(prefix)/share/doc/guile-a-sync2/html/index.html).
