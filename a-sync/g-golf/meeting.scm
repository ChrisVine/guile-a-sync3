;; When using the g-golf bindings for gtk+, in order to provide await
;; semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally be necessary to use
;; the 'await' and 'resume' procedures provided by the a-sync
;; procedure in the (a-sync coroutines) module directly (calling
;; 'resume' in the gtk+ callback when ready, and waiting on that
;; callback using 'await').  However when launching timeouts, file
;; watches or other events on the glib main loop using g-golf,
;; convenience procedures are possible similar to those provided for
;; the event loop in the (a-sync event-loop) module.  These are set
;; out in the files in this directory.
;;
;; Most of the scheme files provided by this library are by default
;; compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with
;; this file, so as not to create a hard dependency on g-golf.

;; This procedure makes and returns a g-meeting object.  g-meetings

;; Strictly speaking this procedure can be called in any native OS
;; thread, but since it carries out no synchronization of native
;; threads the user would have to provide her own synchronization if
;; called in other than the thread of the event loop with respect to
;; which the meeting will be held; so it is best if this procedure is

;; procedure to return with a 'stop-iteration value.

;; procedure waits until a receiver calls g-meeting-receive on one of
;; the g-meeting objects to request the datum.  If a receiver is
;; already waiting, this procedure passes on the datum and returns
;; immediately.
;;
;; This procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
;; invoked by a-sync (which supplies the 'await' and 'resume'
;; arguments).
;;
;; Multiple senders may wait on a g-meeting object to permit fan in.
;; The provided datum of each sender will be passed to a receiver (as
;; and when a receiver becomes available) in the order in which this
;; procedure was invoked.  In addition, this procedure has
;; 'select'-like behavior: multiple g-meeting objects may be passed
;; and this procedure will send to the first one which becomes
;; available to receive the datum.
;;
;; Once a datum exchange has taken place, the g-meeting object(s) can
;; be reused for making another exchange (provided the g-meeting
;; objects have not been closed).
;;
;; This procedure must be called in the native OS thread in which the
;; default glib main loop runs.  To have other native OS threads
;; communicate with that loop, use await-g-task-in-thread,
