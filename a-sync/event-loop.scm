;; This is a convenience procedure whose signature is:
;;
;;   (await-getsomelines! await resume [loop] port proc)
;;
;; This procedure does the same as await-geteveryline!, except that it
;; provides a second argument to 'proc', namely an escape continuation
;; which can be invoked by 'proc' to cause the procedure to return
;; before end-of-file is reached.  Behavior is identical to
;; await-geteveryline! if the continuation is not invoked.
;;
;; This procedure will start a read watch on 'port' for lines of
;; input.  It calls 'await' while waiting for input and will apply
;; 'proc' to any complete line of text received (without the
;; terminating '\n' character).  'proc' should be a procedure taking
;; two arguments, a string as the first argument containing the line
;; of text read, and an escape continuation as its second.
;;
;; The event loop will not be blocked by this procedure even if only
;; individual characters are available at any one time.  It is
;; intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.
;; This procedure is implemented using a-sync-read-watch!.  The watch
;; will not end until end-of-file or an exceptional condition ('excpt)
;; is reached, which would cause this procedure to end and return an
;; end-of-file object or #f respectively, or until the escape
;; continuation is invoked, in which case the value passed to the
;; escape continuation will be returned.
;;
;; The 'loop' argument is optional: this procedure operates on the
;; event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is passed (or #f is
;; passed), on the default event loop.
;;
;; This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the
;; same thread as that in which the event loop runs.
;;
;; Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
;; setting up (that is, before the first call to 'await' is made),
;; which shouldn't happen unless memory is exhausted.  Subsequent
;; exceptions (say, because of port or conversion errors) will
;; propagate out of event-loop-run!.
;;
;; This procedure is available from version 0.4.  From version 0.6,
;; the bytes comprising the input text will be converted to their
;; string representation using the encoding of 'port' if a port
;; encoding has been set, or otherwise using the program's default
;; port encoding, or if neither has been set using iso-8859-1
;; (Latin-1).  Exceptions from conversion errors will, as mentioned,
;; propagate out of event-loop-run!.  Conversion errors should not
;; arise with iso-8859-1 encoding, although strings may not
;; necessarily have the desired meaning for the program concerned if
;; the input encoding is in fact different.  From version 0.7, this
;; procedure uses the conversion strategy for 'port' (which defaults
;; at program start-up to 'substitute); version 0.6 instead always
;; used a conversion strategy of 'error if encountering unconvertible
;; characters).
;;
;; From version 0.6, this procedure may be used with an end-of-line
;; representation of either a line-feed (\n) or a carriage-return and
;; line-feed (\r\n) combination, as from version 0.6 any carriage
;; return byte will be discarded (this did not occur with earlier
;; versions).

;; This is a convenience procedure for use with an event loop, which

;; the return value of 'proc'.  'file' can be a port or a file
;; descriptor (and if it is a file descriptor, the revealed count is
;; not incremented).  'proc' should take a single argument which will
;; be set by the event loop to 'out or 'excpt (see the documentation
;; on event-loop-add-write-watch! for further details).  It is
;; intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.
;; The watch is multi-shot - it is for the user to bring it to an end

;; waitable procedure.  This procedure is mainly intended as something
;; from which higher-level asynchronous file operations can be
;; constructed.  The 'loop' argument is optional: this procedure
;; operates on the event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is

;;
;; Because this procedure takes a 'resume' argument derived from the
;; a-sync procedure, it must (like the a-sync procedure) in practice
;; be called in the same thread as that in which the event loop runs.
