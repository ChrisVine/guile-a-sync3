;; This procedure constructs a thread pool object of native OS
;; threads.  It takes four optional arguments.  The #:max-thread
;; keyname specifies the maximum number of threads which will run in
;; the pool, and the default value is 8.  The #:min-threads keyname
;; specifies the minimum number of persistent threads which will run
;; in the pool and will not be subject to an #:idle timeout, and the
;; default value is 0.  It is an error if #:min-threads is greater
;; than #:max-threads.
;;
;; Thread pool objects with a #:min-threads setting of greater than 0
;; are usually best kept as top level objects, because the minimum
;; value of threads will keep alive in the pool until
;; thread-pool-stop! is called.  If such a thread pool is constructed
;; within a local lexical scope, then either thread-pool-stop! must be
;; applied to the pool before that scope is exited, or the last task
;; added to the pool should itself apply thread-pool-stop! to the pool
;; (which it can do if 'non-blocking' is #t).  Otherwise, the minimum
;; value of threads will remain alive uselessly in blocked condition
;; in the pool until the program terminates, even though the pool may
;; be inaccessible.
;;
;; The #:idle keyname specifies the length of time in milliseconds
;; that threads greater in number than #:min-threads and not executing
;; any tasks will remain in existence.  The default is 5000 (5
;; seconds).
;;
;; The #:non-blocking keyname affects the operation of the
;; thread-pool-stop! procedure.  When set to #f, which is the default,
;; that procedure will not return until all tasks previously added to
;; the pool have completed.  If set to #t, the thread-pool-stop!
;; procedure will return immediately, before all tasks have finished.
;;
;; The #:max-threads, #:non-blocking and #:idle settings may
;; subsequently be altered by applying the
;; thread-pool-change-max-threads!, thread-pool-set-non-blocking! or
;; thread-pool-set-idle-time! procedure to the pool.

;; This procedure will increase, or if 'delta' is negative reduce, the
;; maximum number of threads which the thread pool object will
;; currently run by the value of 'delta'.  The main purpose of this is
;; to enable a task to increment the maximum thread number where it is
;; about to enter a call which may block (non-asynchronously) for some
;; time, with a view to decrementing it later when it has finished
;; making blocking calls, so as to enable another thread to keep a
;; core active.  A with-thread-pool-increment macro is available which
;; will do this for you automatically in an exception-safe way (see
;; the documentation on that macro below).
;;
;; If 'delta' is negative and results in a max-threads value of less
;; than the current number of running threads, the number of threads
;; actually running will only be reduced as tasks complete, or as idle
;; timeouts expire.  The maximum number of threads will not be reduced
;; by this procedure below the min-threads value, or if that value is
;; 0, below 1.
;;
;; This procedure does nothing if thread-pool-stop!  has previously
;; been called.  This procedure is thread safe - any thread may call
;; it.
;;
;; If 'delta' is positive and tasks are currently queued for
;; execution, a new thread or threads will be started for the queued
;; tasks.  This procedure may therefore throw an exception if the
;; system is unable to start the required new thread(s).  Because
;; starting new threads can be time consuming, to minimize contention
;; new threads are started outside the pool's mutex, although internal
;; book-keeping is done within the mutex.  One consequence is that if
;; such an exception is thrown while another thread has concurrently
;; tried to reduce the size of the pool, the number of threads running
;; in the pool may be smaller than it was when this procedure was
;; called.  Where min-threads is 0, in certain circumstances after an
;; exception where no new threads can be started, the pool could have
;; no running threads in it (so that thread-pool-get-num-threads
;; returns 0) even though some tasks previously added to the pool
;; remain pending.  If the system can start no new threads even though
;; none are running in the pool, it will be significantly broken so it
;; is not usually worth troubling about this - the program is doomed
;; in that event whatever.  However if that is wrong and the cause of
;; the failure to start any threads can be addressed, then the thread
;; pool can be brought back into use by calling this procedure again
;; with a positive value (which can be preceded by a call with a
;; negative value to prevent too many threads trying to start).

;; procedure, 'handler' will run in the event loop thread and not in a
