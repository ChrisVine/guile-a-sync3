;; NOTE: The procedures which may be used with await-read-suspendable!
;; and await-write-suspendable! cover most but not all i/o procedures.
;; Thus, the following are safe to use with non-blocking suspendable
;; ports: read-char, get-char, peek-char, lookahead-char, read-line,
;; get-line, get-u8, lookahead-u8, get-bytevector-n, get-string-all,
;; write-char, put-char, put-u8, put-string, put-bytevector, newline,
;; force-output and flush-output-port.  For sockets, the accept and
;; connect procedures are also safe.
;;
;; Some others are not at present safe to use with suspendable ports,
;; including get-bytevector-n!, get-bytevector-some,
;; get-bytevector-all, get-string-n, read, write and display.
;; Unfortunately this means that some of the procedures in guile's web
;; module cannot be used with suspendable ports.  build-uri,
;; build-request and cognates are fine, as is write-request if no
;; custom header writers are imported, but the read-response-body
;; procedure is not.  This means that http-get, http-put and so on
;; cannot normally be used: an example of a safe procedure for reading
;; http responses is in the example-client.scm file in the docs
;; directory.  In addition, guile-gnutls ports are not suspendable.
;; (One answer where only a few gnutls sessions are to be run
;; concurrently is to run each such session in a separate thread using
;; await-task-in-thread!, await-task-in-thread-pool! or
;; await-task-in-event-loop!, and to use synchronous guile-gnutls i/o
;; in the session.)

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;; 'proc' is a procedure taking a single argument, to which the port
;; will be passed when it is invoked.  The purpose of 'proc' is to
;; carry out i/o operations on 'port' using the port's normal read
;; procedures.  'port' must be a suspendable non-blocking port.  This
;; procedure will return when 'proc' returns, as if by blocking read
;; operations.  However, the event loop will not be blocked by this
;; procedure even if only individual characters or bytes comprising
;; part characters are available for reading at any one time.  It is
;; intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync
;; (which supplies the 'await' and 'resume' arguments).  'proc' must
;; not itself explicitly apply 'await' and 'resume' as those are
;; potentially in use by the suspendable port while 'proc' is
;; executing.
;;
;; If an exceptional condition ('excpt) is encountered by the
;; implementation, #f will be returned by this procedure and the read
;; operations to be performed by 'proc' will be abandonned; there is
;; however no guarantee that any exceptional condition that does arise
;; will be encountered by the implementation - the user procedure
;; 'proc' may get there first and deal with it, or it may not.
;; However exceptional conditions are very rare, usually comprising
;; only out-of-band data on a TCP socket, or a pseudoterminal master
;; in packet mode seeing state change in a slave.  In the absence of
;; an exceptional condition, the value(s) returned by 'proc' will be
;; returned ('proc' may return any number of values).
;;
;; The 'loop' argument is optional: this procedure operates on the
;; event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is passed (or #f is
;; passed), on the default event loop.
;;
;; This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the
;; same thread as that in which the event loop runs.
;;
;; Exceptions (say, from 'proc' because of port or conversion errors)
;; will propagate out of this procedure in the first instance, and if
;; not caught locally will then propagate out of event-loop-run!.  If
;; a continuable exception propagates out of this procedure, it will
;; be converted into a non-continuable one (continuable exceptions are
;; incompatible with asynchronous event handling using this procedure
;; and may break resource management which uses rethrows or dynamic
;; winds).
;;
;; Unlike the await-* procedures in the (a-sync event-loop) module,
;; this procedure will not call 'await' if the read operation(s) in
;; 'proc' can be effected immediately without waiting: instead, after
;; reading this procedure would return straight away without invoking
;; the event loop.

;; procedure wraps the guile 'accept' procedure and therefore returns
;; a pair, comprising as car a connection socket, and as cdr a socket
;; address object containing particulars of the address of the remote
;; connection.  The 'loop' argument is optional: this procedure
;; operates on the event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is
;; passed (or #f is passed), on the default event loop.  This
;; procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
;; invoked by a-sync (which supplies the 'await' and 'resume'
;; arguments).

;; See the documentation on the await-read-suspendable! procedure for

;; There are cases where it will not be helpful to use this procedure.
;; Where a connection request is immediately followed by a write to
