;; When using the scheme (gnome gtk) bindings of guile-gnome with
;; guile, in order to provide await semantics on gtk+ callbacks it
;; will normally be necessary to use the 'await' and 'resume'
;; procedures provided by the a-sync procedure in the (a-sync
;; coroutines) module directly (calling 'resume' in the gtk+ callback
;; when ready, and waiting on that callback using 'await').  However
;; when launching timeouts, file watches or idle events on the glib
;; main loop, convenience procedures are possible similar to those
;; provided for the event loop in the (a-sync event-loop) module.
;; These are set out below.
;;
;; Note that the g-idle-add procedure in guile-gnome is suspect -
;; there appears to be a garbage collection issue, and if you call the
;; procedure often enough in a single or multi-threaded program it
;; will eventually segfault.  g-io-add-watch is also broken in
;; guile-gnome, so this file uses its own glib-add-watch procedure
;; which is exported publicly in case it is useful to users.
;;
;; All the other scheme files provided by this library are by default
;; compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with
;; this file, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gnome.

;; This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop,
;; which will run 'proc' in the default glib main loop whenever the
;; file descriptor 'fd' is ready for reading, and apply resume
;; (obtained from a call to a-sync) to the return value of 'proc'.
;; 'proc' should take two arguments, the first of which will be set by
;; glib to the g-io-channel object constructed for the watch and the
;; second of which will be set to the GIOCondition ('in, 'hup or 'err)
;; provided by glib which caused the watch to activate.  It is
;; intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.
;; The watch is multi-shot - it is for the user to bring it to an end
;; at the right time by calling g-source-remove in the waitable
;; procedure on the id tag returned by this procedure.  Any port for
;; the file descriptor 'fd' is not referenced for garbage collection
;; purposes - it must remain valid while the read watch is active.
;; This procedure is mainly intended as something from which
;; higher-level asynchronous file operations can be constructed, such
;; as the await-glib-getline procedure.
;;
;; File watches in guile-gnome are implemented using a GIOChannel
;; object, and unfortunately GIOChannel support in guile-gnome is
;; decaying.  The only procedure that guile-gnome provides to read
;; from a GIOChannel object is g-io-channel-read-line, which does not
;; work.  One is therefore usually left with having to read from a
;; guile port (whose underlying file descriptor is 'fd') using guile's
;; port input procedures, but this has its own difficulties because
;; either (i) the port has to be unbuffered (say by using the
;; open-file or fdopen procedure with the '0' mode option or the R6RS
;; open-file-input-port procedure with a buffer-mode of none, or by
;; calling setvbuf), or (ii) 'proc' must deal with everything in the
;; port's buffer by calling drain-input, or by looping on char-ready?
;; before returning.  This is because otherwise, if the port is
;; buffered, once the port is read from there may be further
;; characters in the buffer to be dealt with even though the
;; GIOChannel watch does not trigger because there is nothing new to
;; make the file descriptor ready for reading.
;;
;; Because this procedure takes a 'resume' argument derived from the
;; a-sync procedure, it must (like the a-sync procedure) in practice
;; be called in the same thread as that in which the default glib main
;; loop runs.
;;
;; This procedure should not throw an exception unless memory is
;; exhausted, or guile-glib throws for some other reason.  If 'proc'
;; throws, say because of port errors, and the exception is not caught
;; locally, it will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

;; This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop,
;; which will start a read watch on 'port' for a line of input.  It
;; calls 'await' while waiting for input and will return the line of
;; text received (without the terminating '\n' character).  The event
;; loop will not be blocked by this procedure even if only individual
;; characters are available at any one time.  It is intended to be
;; called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync, and this
;; procedure is implemented using a-sync-glib-read-watch.  If an
;; end-of-file object is encountered which terminates a line of text,
;; a string containing the line of text will be returned (and from
;; version 0.3, if an end-of-file object is encountered without any
;; text, the end-of-file object is returned rather than an empty
;; string).
;;
;; For the reasons explained in the documentation on
;; a-sync-glib-read-watch, this procedure only works correctly if the
;; port passed to the 'port' argument has buffering switched off.
;; This makes the procedure less useful than would otherwise be the
;; case.
;;
;; This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the
;; same thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.
;;
;; Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
;; setting up (that is, before the first call to 'await' is made),
;; which shouldn't happen unless memory is exhausted.  Subsequent
;; exceptions (say, because of port or conversion errors) will
;; propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
;;
;; From version 0.6, the bytes comprising the input text will be
;; converted to their string representation using the encoding of
;; 'port' if a port encoding has been set, or otherwise using the
;; program's default port encoding, or if neither has been set using
;; iso-8859-1 (Latin-1).  Exceptions from conversion errors will, as
;; mentioned, propagate out of g-main-loop-run.  Conversion errors
;; should not arise with iso-8859-1 encoding, although the string may
;; not necessarily have the desired meaning for the program concerned
;; if the input encoding is in fact different.  From version 0.7, this
;; procedure uses the conversion strategy for 'port' (which defaults
;; at program start-up to 'substitute); version 0.6 instead always
;; used a conversion strategy of 'error if encountering unconvertible
;; characters).
;;
;; From version 0.6, this procedure may be used with an end-of-line
;; representation of either a line-feed (\n) or a carriage-return and
;; line-feed (\r\n) combination, as from version 0.6 any carriage
;; return byte will be discarded (this did not occur with earlier
;; versions).
