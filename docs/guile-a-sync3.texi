This is the guile-a-sync3 library.  It provides both an asynchronous
event loop for guile-3.0, and coroutines to enable an event loop
(including other event loops such as the glib event loop) to be used
with 'await' semantics to deal with inversion of control -- otherwise
known as ``callback hell''.

General overview
* overview::       General overview of the operation of the library

Modules
* coroutines::     (a-sync coroutines) module - provides coroutines for await semantics on asynchronous events
* event loop::     (a-sync event-loop) module - provides an event loop for asynchronous events
* await ports::    (a-sync await-ports) module - provides procedures for suspendable ports
* thread pool::    (a-sync thread-pool) module - provides a thread pool with asychonous procedures
* monotonic time:: (a-sync monotonic-time) module - enables monotonic time to be used for timeouts
* gnome glib::     (a-sync gnome-glib) module - provides some convenience await procedures for the glib main loop
* compose::        (a-sync compose) module - provides the compose-a-sync macro interface for the a-sync coroutine
* meeting::        (a-sync meeting) module - provides for synchronization between a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks
