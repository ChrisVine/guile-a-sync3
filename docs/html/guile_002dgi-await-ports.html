<h4 class="node-heading">guile-gi await ports</h4>

<p>Most of the scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gi.
</p>
<p>Including this module will automatically enable suspendable ports.  To
disable suspendable ports again, uninstall-suspendable-ports! can be
called, but this means that those procedures can no longer be used
while suspendable ports are disabled.  In addition, any port using
those procedures must be made non-blocking using fcntl as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(fcntl [port] F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK
                      (fcntl [port] F_GETFL)))
</pre></div>

<p>See the introductory remarks at <a href="await-ports.html">(a-sync
await-ports)</a> for more about the guile i/o procedures which can safely
be used with suspendable ports (and so with
await-glib-read-suspendable and await-glib-write-suspendable).
</p>
<p>The (a-sync guile-gi await-ports) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl class="def">
<dt id="index-await_002dglib_002dread_002dsuspendable-2"><span class="category">Scheme Procedure: </span><span><strong>await-glib-read-suspendable</strong> <em>await resume port proc</em><a href='#index-await_002dglib_002dread_002dsuspendable-2' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>&rsquo;proc&rsquo; is a procedure taking a single argument, to which the port will
be passed when it is invoked.  The purpose of &rsquo;proc&rsquo; is to carry out
i/o operations on &rsquo;port&rsquo; using the port&rsquo;s normal read procedures.
&rsquo;port&rsquo; must be a suspendable non-blocking port.  This procedure will
return when &rsquo;proc&rsquo; returns, as if by blocking read operations, with
the value returned by &rsquo;proc&rsquo;.  However, the glib main loop will not be
blocked by this procedure even if only individual characters or bytes
comprising part characters are available at any one time.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which
supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; must not itself
explicitly apply &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; as those are potentially in use
by the suspendable port while &rsquo;proc&rsquo; is executing.
</p>
<p>If an exceptional condition (&rsquo;pri) is encountered by the
implementation, #f will be returned by this procedure and the read
operations to be performed by &rsquo;proc&rsquo; will be abandonned; there is
however no guarantee that any exceptional condition that does arise
will be encountered by the implementation - the user procedure &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
may get there first and deal with it, or it may not.  However
exceptional conditions are very rare, usually comprising only
out-of-band data on a TCP socket, or a pseudoterminal master in packet
mode seeing state change in a slave.  In the absence of an exceptional
condition, the value(s) returned by &rsquo;proc&rsquo; will be returned.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.
</p>
<p>Exceptions (say, from &rsquo;proc&rsquo; because of port or conversion errors)
will propagate out of this procedure in the first instance, and if not
caught locally will then propagate out of main-loop:run.  If a
continuable exception propagates out of this procedure, it will be
converted into a non-continuable one (continuable exceptions are
incompatible with asynchronous event handling using this procedure and
may break resource management which uses rethrows or dynamic winds).
</p>
<p>Unlike the await-* procedures in the (a-sync guile-gi base) module,
this procedure will not call &rsquo;await&rsquo; if the read operation(s) in
&rsquo;proc&rsquo; can be effected immediately without waiting: instead, after
reading this procedure would return straight away without invoking the
glib main loop.
</p>
<p>As an example of how to use await-glib-read-suspendable, here is the
implementation of await-glib-getline:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define (await-glib-getline await resume port)
  (await-glib-read-suspendable await resume port
			       (lambda (p)
				 (read-line p))))
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dd><p>This procedure is provided mainly to retain compatibility with the
guile-a-sync library for guile-2.0, because it is trivial to implement

await-glib-read-suspendable).
</p>
<p>It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync,
and reads a line of text from a non-blocking suspendable port and
returns it (without the terminating &rsquo;\n&rsquo; character).  See the
documentation on the await-glib-read-suspendable procedure for further
particulars about this procedure.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-glib-getline:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define main-loop (main-loop:new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)

happening, this procedure will end and return an end-of-file object or
#f respectively.
</p>
<p>When &rsquo;proc&rsquo; executes, &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; will still be in use by
this procedure, so they may not be reused by &rsquo;proc&rsquo; (even though

</p>
<p>See the documentation on the await-glib-read-suspendable procedure for

<dd><p>This procedure is provided mainly to retain compatibility with the
guile-a-sync library for guile-2.0, because it is trivial to implement
with await-glib-write-suspendable (and is implemented by
await-glib-write-suspendable).
</p>
<p>This procedure will connect socket &rsquo;sock&rsquo; to a remote host.
Particulars of the remote host are given by &rsquo;args&rsquo; which are the
arguments (other than &rsquo;sock&rsquo;) taken by guile&rsquo;s &rsquo;connect&rsquo; procedure,
which this procedure wraps.  &rsquo;sock&rsquo; must be a non-blocking socket
port.  This procedure is intended to be called in a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
</p>
<p>There are cases where it will not be helpful to use this procedure.
Where a connection request is immediately followed by a write to the
remote server (say, a get request), the call to &rsquo;connect&rsquo; and to
&rsquo;put-string&rsquo; can be combined in a single procedure passed to
await-glib-write-suspendable.
</p>
<p>See the documentation on the await-glib-write-suspendable procedure
for further particulars about this procedure.
