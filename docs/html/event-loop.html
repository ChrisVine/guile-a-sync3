<h4 class="node-heading">event loop</h4>

<p>The (a-sync event-loop) module provides an event loop for asynchronous
operations.  The event loop does not of itself start any new threads.
Instead it runs in the thread which calls event-loop-run!: that
procedure will block while there are events to be processed.  In most
programs the event loop will run in the main program thread, with
which the program began.  Many programs using event loops are entirely
single threaded.
</p>
<p>However, the event loop provided by this module does support multiple
threads.  Most of the event loop procedures in this module are thread
safe and may be called in any thread.  The thread safe procedures are
event-loop-run! (as mentioned, this will cause the event loop to run
in the thread which calls it), event-loop-block!, event-loop-quit!,
event-post!, event-loop-tasks, event-loop-add-read-watch!,
event-loop-add-write-watch!, event-loop-remove-read-watch!,
event-loop-remove-write-watch!, timeout-post! and timeout-remove!.  In
particular, event-post! allows worker threads to post an event to an
event loop, say with the result of a computation, so that the event
callback will execute in the event loop thread.
</p>
<p><a href="meeting.html">(a-sync meeting)</a> provides synchronization facilities
for event loops constructed under this module.
</p>
<p>The file watches provided by this module use guile&rsquo;s wrapper for the
select() system call.  This has two consequences.  First, in linux
select() applied to sockets can give rise to spurious wake-ups, which
means that it may be best with sockets to set the socket as
non-blocking using the guile wrapper for the fcntl() system call in
order to prevent a blocking read where it is not expected.  With
guile-3.0 this means that with such sockets, suspendable ports should
be used with the await-read-suspendable! or await-write-suspendable!
procedures in the <a href="await-ports.html">(a-sync await-ports)</a> module.
Secondly, with select() the file descriptor value of a port passed to
the watch should not exceed FD_SETSIZE.  Normally, by default the
maximum soft user limit for open files is the same as FD_SETSIZE, and
it is best if this situation is retained by user code.
</p>
<p>Where a file watch on a file descriptor or port has been added with
event-loop-add-read-watch! or event-loop-add-write-watch!, the event
loop should be treated as owning the descriptor or port until it has
subsequently been removed with event-loop-remove-read-watch! or
event-loop-remove-write-watch!.  In particular, if the watch is on a
port, an error in the fileno or select procedures will arise at some
point if the port is closed (say by calling close, close-port,
close-input-port or close-output-port) before its watch has been
removed from the event loop; if the watch is on a file descriptor and
the descriptor value is reused by the operating system, there may be a
phantom watch on the new descriptor.  Also note that, where a watch on
a port has just been removed, it is usually undesirable to close the
port in a different thread than the event loop thread because there is
no easy way of synchronizing the threads at that point.  If it is
necessary for a worker thread to close a port after removing the
watch, one approach is for the thread to post the closing as an event
using event-post!.
</p>
<p>Including this module will automatically enable suspendable ports.
The uninstall-suspendable-ports! procedure should not subsequently be
applied, or the procedures in this module (and in the (a-sync
await-ports) module) will not work correctly.
</p>
<p>This module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002ddefault_002devent_002dloop_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>set-default-event-loop!</strong> <em>[loop]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; (event loop) argument is optional.  This procedure sets the
default event loop for the procedures in this module to the one passed
in (which must have been constructed by the make-event-loop
procedure), or if no argument is passed (or #f is passed), a new event
loop will be constructed for you as the default, which can be accessed
via the get-default-event-loop procedure.  The default loop variable
is not a fluid or a parameter - it is intended that the default event
loop is the same for every thread in the program, and that the default
event loop would normally run in the thread with which the program
started.  This procedure is not thread safe - if it might be called by
a different thread from others which might access the default event
loop, then external synchronization may be required.  However, that
should not normally be an issue.  The normal course would be to call
this procedure once only on program start up, before other threads
have started.  It is usually a mistake to call this procedure twice:
if there are asynchronous events pending (that is, if event-loop-run!
has not returned) you will probably not get the results you expect.
</p>
<p>Note that if a default event-loop is constructed for you because no
argument is passed (or #f is passed), no throttling arguments are
applied to it (see the documentation on make-event-loop for more about
that).  If throttling is wanted, the make-event-loop procedure should
be called explicitly and the result passed to this procedure.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-get_002ddefault_002devent_002dloop">Scheme Procedure: <strong>get-default-event-loop</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This returns the default loop set by the set-default-event-loop!
procedure, or #f if none has been set.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002devent_002dloop">Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-event-loop</strong> <em>[throttle-threshold throttle-delay]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure constructs a new event loop object.
</p>
<p>This procedure optionally takes two throttling arguments for
backpressure when applying the event-post! procedure to the event
loop.  The &rsquo;throttle-threshold&rsquo; argument specifies the number of
unexecuted tasks queued for execution, by virtue of calls to
event-post!, at which throttling will first be applied.  Where the
threshold is exceeded, throttling proceeds by adding a wait to any
thread which calls the event-post! procedure, equal to the cube of the
number of times (if any) by which the number of queued tasks exceeds
the threshold multiplied by the value of &rsquo;throttle-delay&rsquo;.  The value
of &rsquo;throttle-delay&rsquo; should be given in microseconds.  Throttling is
only applied where the call to event-post! is made in a thread other
than the one in which the event loop runs.
</p>
<p>So if the threshold given is 10000 tasks and the delay given is 1000
microseconds, upon 10000 unexecuted tasks accumulating a delay of 1000
microseconds will be applied to callers of event-post! which are not
in the event loop thread, at 20000 unexecuted tasks a delay of 8000
microseconds will be applied, and at 30000 unexecuted tasks a delay of
27000 microseconds will be applied, and so on.
</p>
<p>If throttle-threshold and throttle-delay arguments are not provided
(or #f is passed for them), then no throttling takes place.
</p></dd></dl>

<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; (event loop) argument is optional.  This procedure starts
the event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is passed (or #f
is passed) it starts the default event loop.  The event loop will run
in the thread which calls this procedure.  If this procedure has
returned, including after a call to event-loop-quit!, this procedure
may be called again to restart the event loop, provided
event-loop-close! has not been applied to the loop.  If
event-loop-close! has previously been invoked, this procedure will
throw an &rsquo;event-loop-error exception.  This procedure will also throw
an &rsquo;event-loop-error exception if it is applied to an event loop which
is currently running.
</p>
<p>If something else throws in the implementation or a callback throws,
then this procedure will clean up the event loop as if
event-loop-quit! had been called, and the exception will be rethrown
out of this procedure.

<dl>
<dt id="index-event_002dloop_002dadd_002dread_002dwatch_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>event-loop-add-read-watch!</strong> <em>file proc [loop]</em></dt>
<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; (event loop) argument is optional.  This procedure will
start a read watch in the event loop passed in as an argument, or if
none is passed (or #f is passed), in the default event loop.  The
&rsquo;proc&rsquo; callback should take a single argument, and when called this
will be set to &rsquo;in or &rsquo;excpt.  The same port or file descriptor can
also be passed to event-loop-add-write-watch, and if so and the
descriptor is also available for writing, the write callback will also
be called with its argument set to &rsquo;out.  If there is already a read
watch for the file passed, the old one will be replaced by the new
one.  If &rsquo;proc&rsquo; returns #f, the read watch will be removed from the
event loop, otherwise the watch will continue.  This is thread safe -
any thread may add a watch, and the callback will execute in the event
loop thread.  The file argument can be either a port or a file
descriptor.  If &rsquo;file&rsquo; is a file descriptor, any port for the
descriptor is not referenced for garbage collection purposes - it must
remain valid while operations are carried out on the descriptor.  If
&rsquo;file&rsquo; is a buffered port, buffering will be taken into account in
indicating whether a read can be made without blocking (but on a
buffered port, for efficiency purposes each read operation in response
to this watch should usually exhaust the buffer by calling drain-input
or by looping on char-ready?, or the port&rsquo;s ordinary input procedures
should be used with suspendable ports using the
await-read-suspendable!  procedure in the <a href="await-ports.html">(a-sync
await-ports)</a> module).
</p>
<p>This procedure should not throw an exception unless memory is
exhausted.

start a write watch in the event loop passed in as an argument, or if
none is passed (or #f is passed), in the default event loop.  The
&rsquo;proc&rsquo; callback should take a single argument, and when called this
will be set to &rsquo;out or &rsquo;excpt.  The same port or file descriptor can
also be passed to event-loop-add-read-watch, and if so and the
descriptor is also available for reading or in exceptional condition,
the read callback will also be called with its argument set to &rsquo;in or
&rsquo;excpt (if both a read and a write watch have been set for the same
file argument, and there is an exceptional condition, it is the read
watch procedure which will be called with &rsquo;excpt rather than the write
watch procedure, so if that procedure returns #f only the read watch
will be removed).  If there is already a write watch for the file
passed, the old one will be replaced by the new one.  If &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
returns #f, the write watch will be removed from the event loop,
otherwise the watch will continue.  This is thread safe - any thread
may add a watch, and the callback will execute in the event loop
thread.  The file argument can be either a port or a file descriptor.
If &rsquo;file&rsquo; is a file descriptor, any port for the descriptor is not
referenced for garbage collection purposes - it must remain valid
while operations are carried out on the descriptor.
</p>
<p>If &rsquo;file&rsquo; is a buffered port, buffering will be taken into account in
indicating whether a write can be made without blocking, either
because there is room in the buffer for a character, or because the
underlying file descriptor is ready for a character.  This can have
unintended consequences: if the buffer is full but the underlying file
descriptor is ready for a character, the next write will cause a
buffer flush, and if the size of the buffer is greater than the number
of characters that the file can receive without blocking, blocking
might still occur.  Unless the port will carry out a partial flush in
such a case, this procedure will therefore generally work best either
with unbuffered ports (say by using the open-file, fdopen or
duplicate-port procedure with the &rsquo;0&rsquo; mode option or the R6RS
open-file-input-port procedure with a buffer-mode of none, or by
calling setvbuf), or the port&rsquo;s ordinary output procedures should be
used with suspendable ports using the await-write-suspendable!
procedure in the <a href="await-ports.html">(a-sync await-ports)</a> module.

the main loop after it has reached a result, say via
await-task-in-thread!, because the main loop may have ended before it

that from happening, so that the event loop can only be ended by
calling event-loop-quit!, or by calling event-loop-block! again with a
#f argument (to switch the event loop back to non-blocking mode, pass

the loop as may previously have been set by event-loop-block!, should
event-loop-run! be applied to it again.
</p>
<p>Applying this procedure to an event loop has no effect if the event
loop is not actually running.  Unlike the await-* procedures in this
module, the await-* procedures in the <a href="await-ports.html">(a-sync
await-ports)</a> module do not pass control to the event loop if they can
operate immediately without waiting, so if (i) the event loop
concerned has been set blocking by event-loop-block!, (ii) this
procedure is invoked in an a-sync or compose-a-sync block in order to
bring the event loop to an end, and (iii) before invoking this
procedure the a-sync or compose-a-sync block has done nothing except
make a call to one or more of the await-* procedures in the <a href="await-ports.html">(a-sync await-ports)</a> module, then in order to make sure the
loop is running consider calling await-yield! or some similar
procedure before applying this procedure.

<p>Note that the discarding of file watches, timeouts and unexecuted
events remaining in the event loop means that if one of the helper
await-* procedures provided by this library has been called but has
not yet returned, it may fail to complete, as its continuation may
disappear - it will be as if the a-sync or compose-a-sync block
concerned had come to an end.  It may therefore be best only to call

the internal event pipe ports, and any subsequent application of

&rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.  &rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take a single argument, which will be the
thrown exception object.

<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same

setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.

handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of event-loop-run!.

loop running in a different thread than the one in which this
procedure is called, and is the one in which &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will be executed
by posting an event to that loop.  The result of executing &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;
will then be posted to the event loop specified by the &rsquo;waiter&rsquo;
argument, or to the default event loop if no &rsquo;waiter&rsquo; argument is
provided or if #f is provided as the &rsquo;waiter&rsquo; argument, and will
comprise this procedure&rsquo;s return value.  This procedure is intended to
be called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which
supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  It will normally be
necessary to call event-loop-block! on &rsquo;waiter&rsquo; (or on the default
event loop) before invoking this procedure.
</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and must (like the a-sync procedure) be
called in the same thread as that in which the &rsquo;waiter&rsquo; or default
event loop runs (as the case may be).
</p>
<p>This procedure acts as a form of channel through which two different
event loops may communicate.  It also offers a means by which a master
event loop (the waiter or default event loop) may allocate work to
worker event loops for execution.
</p>
<p>Depending on the circumstances, it may be desirable to provide
throttling arguments when constructing the &rsquo;worker&rsquo; event loop, in
order to enable backpressure to be supplied if the &rsquo;worker&rsquo; event loop
becomes overloaded: see the documentation on the make-event-loop
procedure for further information about that.  (This procedure calls
event-post! in both the &rsquo;waiter&rsquo; and &rsquo;worker&rsquo; event loops by the
respective threads of the other, so either could be subject to
throttling.)
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up, which shouldn&rsquo;t happen unless memory is exhausted or
pthread has run out of resources.  Exceptions arising during execution
of the task, if not caught locally, will propagate out of the
event-loop-run! procedure called for the &rsquo;worker&rsquo; event loop.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of await-task-in-event-loop!:

<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional.  This is a convenience procedure for
use with an event loop, which will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in the event loop
specified by the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or in the default event loop if no
&rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is provided or #f is provided as the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument.
This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return the thunk&rsquo;s return value.
It is intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by
a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  It is the
single-threaded corollary of await-task-in-thread!.  This means that
(unlike with await-task-in-thread!) while &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; is running other
events in the event loop will not make progress, so blocking calls
should not be made in &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>This procedure can be used for the purpose of implementing
co-operative multi-tasking.  However, when &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; is executed, this
procedure is waiting on &rsquo;await&rsquo;, so &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; cannot be
used again in &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; (although &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; can call a-sync to start
another series of asynchronous operations with a new await-resume
pair).  For that reason, await-yield! is usually more convenient for
composing asynchronous tasks.  In retrospect, this procedure offers
little over await-yield!, apart from symmetry with
await-task-in-thread!.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the event loop runs.
</p>
<p>This procedure calls event-post! in the event loop concerned.  This is
done in the same thread as that in which the event loop runs so it
cannot of itself be throttled.  However it may contribute to the
number of accumulated unexecuted tasks in the event loop and therefore
contribute to the throttling of other threads by the loop.  See the
documentation on the make-event-loop procedure for further information
about that.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the task starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t happen

<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure which will surrender execution to the

await-yield! in the current a-sync or compose-a-sync block will
execute on the next iteration through the loop.  It is intended to be
called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which supplies
the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  It&rsquo;s effect is similar to
calling await-task! with a task that does nothing.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same

&quot;the relevant event loop&quot; is the event loop given by the &rsquo;loop&rsquo;

<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; and &rsquo;handler&rsquo; arguments are optional.  The &rsquo;generator&rsquo;
argument is a procedure taking one argument, namely a yield argument
(see the documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further
details).  This await-generator-in-thread! procedure will run
&rsquo;generator&rsquo; in its own worker thread, and whenever &rsquo;generator&rsquo; yields
a value will cause &rsquo;proc&rsquo; to execute in the event loop specified by
the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument (or in the default event loop if no &rsquo;loop&rsquo;
argument is provided or if #f is provided as the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument -
pattern matching is used to detect the type of the third argument).
</p>
<p>&rsquo;proc&rsquo; should be a procedure taking a single argument, namely the
value yielded by the generator.  If the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is
provided, then that handler will be run in the event loop thread if
&rsquo;generator&rsquo; throws; otherwise the program will terminate if an
unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;generator&rsquo;.  &rsquo;handler&rsquo; should
take a single argument, which will be the thrown exception object.
</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and will return when the generator has
finished or, if &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is provided, upon the generator throwing an
exception.  This procedure will return #f if the generator completes
normally, or &rsquo;guile-a-sync-thread-error if the generator throws an
exception and &rsquo;handler&rsquo; is run (the &rsquo;guile-a-sync-thread-error symbol
is reserved to the implementation and should not be yielded by the
generator).
</p>
<p>This procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
It will normally be necessary to call event-loop-block! before
invoking this procedure.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the event loop runs.  As mentioned above, the
generator itself will run in its own thread.
</p>
<p>As the worker thread calls event-post!, it might be subject to
throttling by the event loop concerned.  See the documentation on the
make-event-loop procedure for further information about that.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the generator, if not caught by
a handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of event-loop-run!.
Exceptions thrown by &rsquo;proc&rsquo;, if not caught locally, will also
propagate out of event-loop-run!.
