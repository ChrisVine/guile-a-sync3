<h4 class="node-heading">await ports</h4>

<p>The (a-sync await-ports) module provides procedures for using
guile-3.0&rsquo;s suspendable ports with event loops, and a convenient way
of using ports&rsquo; normal input and output procedures with non-blocking
ports.
</p>
<p>For this purpose, the &rsquo;normal input and output&rsquo; procedures which may
be used with await-read-suspendable! and await-write-suspendable!
cover most but not all i/o procedures.  Thus, the following are safe
to use with non-blocking suspendable ports: read-char, get-char,
peek-char, lookahead-char, read-line, get-line, get-u8, lookahead-u8,
get-bytevector-n, get-string-all, write-char, put-char, put-u8,
put-string, put-bytevector, newline, force-output and
flush-output-port.  For sockets, the accept and connect procedures are
also safe.
</p>
<p>Some others are not at present safe to use with suspendable ports,
including get-bytevector-n!, get-bytevector-some, get-bytevector-all,
get-string-n, read, write and display.  Unfortunately this means that
some of the procedures in guile&rsquo;s web module cannot be used with
suspendable ports.  build-uri, build-request and cognates are fine, as
is write-request if no custom header writers are imported, but the
read-response-body procedure is not.  This means that http-get,
http-put and so on cannot normally be used: an example of a safe
procedure for reading http responses is in the example-client.scm file
in the docs directory.  In addition, guile-gnutls ports are not
suspendable.  (One answer where only a few gnutls sessions are to be
run concurrently is to run each such session in a separate thread
using await-task-in-thread!, await-task-in-thread-pool! or
await-task-in-event-loop!, and to use synchronous guile-gnutls i/o in
the session.)
</p>
<p>Including this module will automatically enable suspendable ports.
The uninstall-suspendable-ports! procedure should not subsequently be
applied, or the procedures in this module (and in the (a-sync
event-loop) module) will not work correctly.  Any port using these
procedures must be made non-blocking using fcntl as follows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(fcntl [port] F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK
                      (fcntl [port] F_GETFL)))
</pre></div>

<dl>
<dt id="index-await_002dread_002dsuspendable_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-read-suspendable!</strong> <em>await resume [loop] port proc</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure is provided to implement read file watches using
guile-3.0&rsquo;s suspendable ports.  &rsquo;proc&rsquo; is a procedure taking a single
argument, to which the port will be passed when it is invoked.  The
purpose of &rsquo;proc&rsquo; is to carry out i/o operations on &rsquo;port&rsquo; using the
port&rsquo;s normal read procedures.  &rsquo;port&rsquo; must be a suspendable
non-blocking port.  This procedure will return when &rsquo;proc&rsquo; returns, as
if by blocking read operations.  However, the event loop will not be
blocked by this procedure even if only individual characters or bytes
comprising part characters are available for reading at any one time.
It is intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by
a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
must not itself explicitly apply &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; as those are
potentially in use by the suspendable port while &rsquo;proc&rsquo; is executing.
</p>
<p>If an exceptional condition (&rsquo;excpt) is encountered by the
implementation, #f will be returned by this procedure and the read
operations to be performed by &rsquo;proc&rsquo; will be abandonned; there is
however no guarantee that any exceptional condition that does arise
will be encountered by the implementation - the user procedure &rsquo;proc&rsquo;
may get there first and deal with it, or it may not.  However
exceptional conditions are very rare, usually comprising only
out-of-band data on a TCP socket, or a pseudoterminal master in packet
mode seeing state change in a slave.  In the absence of an exceptional
condition, the value(s) returned by &rsquo;proc&rsquo; will be returned (&rsquo;proc&rsquo;
may return any number of values).
</p>
<p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional: this procedure operates on the event
loop passed in as an argument, or if none is passed (or #f is passed),
on the default event loop.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the event loop runs.
</p>
<p>Exceptions (say, from &rsquo;proc&rsquo; because of port or conversion errors)
will propagate out of this procedure in the first instance, and if not
caught locally will then propagate out of event-loop-run!.  If a
continuable exception propagates out of this procedure, it will be
converted into a non-continuable one (continuable exceptions are
incompatible with asynchronous event handling using this procedure and
may break resource management which uses rethrows or dynamic winds).
</p>
<p>Unlike the await-* procedures in the <a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync
event-loop)</a> module, this procedure will not call &rsquo;await&rsquo; if the read
operation(s) in &rsquo;proc&rsquo; can be effected immediately without waiting:
instead, after reading this procedure would return straight away
without invoking the event loop.
</p>
<p>As an example of how to use await-read-suspendable!, here is the
implementation of await-getline!:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(define await-getline!
  (case-lambda
    ((await resume port)
     (await-getline! await resume #f port))

			      (lambda (p)
				(read-line p))))))

<p>It is intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by
a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments), and reads
a line of text from a non-blocking suspendable port and returns it

optional: this procedure operates on the event loop passed in as an

implementation, #f will be returned by this procedure and the read

immediately around this procedure) will then propagate out of
event-loop-run!.  So one way of testing for EPIPE is as follows:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">(set-default-event-loop!) ;; if none has yet been set
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (catch 'system-error
		 (lambda ()
		   (await-put-string! await resume port &quot;test&quot;))
		 (lambda args
		   (if (= (system-error-errno args) EPIPE)
		       (begin
			 ... do something to cater for EPIPE ...)
		       (begin
			 ;; possibly rethrow the exception
			 (apply throw args)))))))
(event-loop-run!)
</pre></div>

<p>An example of the use of this procedure can also be found in the
example-socket.scm file in the docs directory.

<dd><p>This procedure is provided mainly to retain compatibility with the

<p>This procedure will start a watch on listening socket &rsquo;sock&rsquo; for a
connection.  &rsquo;sock&rsquo; must be a non-blocking socket port.  This
procedure wraps the guile &rsquo;accept&rsquo; procedure and therefore returns a
pair, comprising as car a connection socket, and as cdr a socket
address object containing particulars of the address of the remote
connection.  The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional: this procedure operates
on the event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is passed (or
#f is passed), on the default event loop.  This procedure is intended
to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which
supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
</p>
<p>See the documentation on the await-read-suspendable! procedure for
further particulars about this procedure.

<dd><p>This procedure is provided mainly to retain compatibility with the

</p>
<p>This procedure will connect socket &rsquo;sock&rsquo; to a remote host.
Particulars of the remote host are given by &rsquo;args&rsquo; which are the
arguments (other than &rsquo;sock&rsquo;) taken by guile&rsquo;s &rsquo;connect&rsquo; procedure,
which this procedure wraps.  &rsquo;sock&rsquo; must be a non-blocking socket
port.  The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional: this procedure operates on the
event loop passed in as an argument, or if none is passed (or #f is
passed), on the default event loop.  This procedure is intended to be
called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which supplies
the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
</p>
<p>There are cases where it will not be helpful to use this procedure.
Where a connection request is immediately followed by a write to the
remote server (say, a get request), the call to &rsquo;connect&rsquo; and to
&rsquo;put-string&rsquo; can be combined in a single procedure passed to
await-write-suspendable!.
</p>
<p>See the documentation on the await-write-suspendable! procedure for
further particulars about this procedure.
