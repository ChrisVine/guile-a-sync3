<h4 class="node-heading">guile-gi base</h4>

<p>When using the guile-gi bindings for gtk+, in order to provide await
semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally be necessary to use the
&rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; procedures provided by the a-sync procedure in
the <a href="coroutines.html">(a-sync coroutines)</a> module directly (calling
&rsquo;resume&rsquo; in the gtk+ callback when ready, and waiting on that callback
using &rsquo;await&rsquo;).  However when launching timeouts, file watches or
other events on the glib main loop using guile-gi, convenience
procedures are possible similar to those provided for the event loop
in the <a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  These are set
out in these (a-sync guile-gi ...) modules.
</p>
<p>Most of the scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gi.
</p>
<p>The (a-sync guile-gi base) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-a_002dsync_002dglib_002dquit-1">Scheme Procedure: <strong>a-sync-glib-quit</strong> <em>loop</em></dt>
<dd><p>Usually the default glib main loop runs throughout a program&rsquo;s
lifetime and only quits (say, via GTK) when the program is brought to
an end by the user.  Notwithstanding that, in a non-GUI program
sometimes you may need to quit the main loop programmatically (most of
the glib example code in this library does so).  To quit a main loop
using main-loop:quit, the loop must be running.  One problem that may
arise from this is that the suspendable port procedures in the (a-sync
guile-gi await-ports) module do not suspend to the main loop if they
do not need to.  This procedure deals with the issue by posting a
main-loop:quit event to the main loop instead of calling
main-loop:quit directly, so ensuring that the main loop must be
running when main-loop:quit is called.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-await_002dglib_002dtask_002din_002dthread-2">Scheme Procedure: <strong>await-glib-task-in-thread</strong> <em>await resume thunk [handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is a convenience procedure which will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in its own
thread, and then post an event to the default glib main loop when
&rsquo;thunk&rsquo; has finished.  This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; in the default
glib main loop and will return the thunk&rsquo;s return value.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  If
the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then it will be run in
the default glib main loop if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; throws and its return value will
be the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take a single argument, which will be the thrown
exception object.
</p>
<p>This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs, where the
result of calling &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will be received.  As mentioned above, the
thunk itself will run in its own thread.
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn&rsquo;t
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the task, if not caught by a
handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of main-loop:run.

<p>When &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; is executed, this procedure is waiting on &rsquo;await&rsquo;, so
&rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; cannot be used again in &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; (although &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;
can call a-sync to start another series of asynchronous operations
with a new await-resume pair).  For that reason, await-glib-yield is
usually more convenient for composing asynchronous tasks.  In
retrospect, this procedure offers little over await-glib-yield, apart
from symmetry with await-glib-task-in-thread.
