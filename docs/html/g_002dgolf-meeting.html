<h4 class="node-heading">g-golf meeting</h4>

<p>As explained in the <a href="overview.html">general overview</a>, each &rsquo;a-sync&rsquo;
block (see <a href="coroutines.html">(a-sync coroutines)</a>) or &rsquo;compose-a-sync&rsquo;
block (see <a href="compose.html">(a-sync compose)</a>) is a separate unit of
computation which appears within itself to proceed sequentially but
which also appears to execute concurrently with other &rsquo;a-sync&rsquo; or
&rsquo;compose-a-sync&rsquo; blocks running on the same event loop.  Each &rsquo;a-sync&rsquo;
or &rsquo;compose-a-sync&rsquo; block is therefore in some sense analogous to a
thread of execution.
</p>
<p>This (a-sync g-golf meeting) module provides a &rsquo;g-meeting&rsquo; type which
can be used to synchronize between such &quot;pseudo-threads&quot; (that is,
between a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks) running on the default glib
main loop.  A &rsquo;g-meeting&rsquo; object is, in terms of communicating
sequential processes, an unbuffered (synchronous) channel.  Unbuffered
channels in the CSP style are a natural fit for use with coroutines
running on a single native thread (but not necessarily for native
threads running in parallel unless combined with work stealing).  They
are therefore a natural fit for synchronizing the &quot;pseudo-threads&quot;
provided by this library.
</p>
<p>Look at the <a href="meeting.html">(a-sync meeting)</a> documentation for examples
of the use of meeting objects and how and when synchronization takes
place, which applies also to g-meeting objects: this is not repeated
again here, save to translate the parallel-map example to g-meeting
form:

<p>The (a-sync meeting) module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002dg_002dmeeting">Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-g-meeting</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure makes and returns a g-meeting object.  g-meetings
are objects on which a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks running on the
default glib main loop can synchronize by one passing a datum to
another.
</p>
<p>Strictly speaking this procedure can be called in any native OS
thread, but since it carries out no synchronization of native
threads the user would have to provide her own synchronization if
called in other than the thread of the event loop with respect to
which the meeting will be held; so it is best if this procedure is
called in the thread of that event loop.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-g_002dmeeting_003f">Scheme Procedure: <strong>g-meeting?</strong> <em>obj</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure indicates whether &rsquo;obj&rsquo; is a g-meeting object
constructed by make-g-meeting.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-g_002dmeeting_002dclose">Scheme Procedure: <strong>g-meeting-close</strong> <em>meeting</em></dt>
<dd><p>This closes a g-meeting object.  It&rsquo;s purpose is to wake up any
&quot;pseudo-thread&quot; (that is, any a-sync or compose-a-sync block) waiting
in g-meeting-send or g-meeting-receive by causing either procedure to
return with a &rsquo;stop-iteration value.
</p>
<p>Where that is not necessary (say, the receiver already knows how many
items are to be sent), then this procedure does not need to be
applied.  It is not needed in order to release resources.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-g_002dmeeting_002dready_003f">Scheme Procedure: <strong>g-meeting-ready?</strong> <em>meeting</em></dt>
<dd><p>This indicates whether applying g-meeting-send or
g-meeting-receive (as the case may be) to the g-meeting object
&rsquo;meeting&rsquo; will return immediately: in other words, this procedure will
return #t if another a-sync or compose-a-sync block is already waiting
on the object or the g-meeting object has been closed, otherwise #f.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-g_002dmeeting_002dsend">Scheme Procedure: <strong>g-meeting-send</strong> <em>await resume m0 [m1 ...] datum</em></dt>
<dd><p>This sends a datum to a receiver via one or more g-meeting objects &rsquo;m0
m1 ...&rsquo;.  If no receiver is waiting for the datum, this procedure
waits until a receiver calls g-meeting-receive on one of the g-meeting
objects to request the datum.  If a receiver is already waiting, this
procedure passes on the datum and returns immediately.
</p>
<p>This procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
</p>
<p>Multiple senders may wait on a g-meeting object to permit fan in.  The
provided datum of each sender will be passed to a receiver (as and
when a receiver becomes available) in the order in which this
procedure was invoked.  In addition, this procedure has &rsquo;select&rsquo;-like
behavior: multiple g-meeting objects may be passed and this procedure
will send to the first one which becomes available to receive the
datum.
</p>
<p>Once a datum exchange has taken place, the g-meeting object(s) can be
reused for making another exchange (provided the g-meeting objects
have not been closed).
</p>
<p>This procedure must be called in the native OS thread in which the
default glib main loop runs.  To have other native OS threads
communicate with that loop, use await-g-task-in-thread,
await-g-generator-in-thread, await-g-task-in-thread-pool or
await-g-generator-in-thread-pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure always returns #f unless g-meeting-close has been
applied to a g-meeting object, in which case &rsquo;stop-iteration is
returned.  Note that if multiple g-meeting objects are passed to this
procedure and one of them is then closed, this procedure will return
&rsquo;stop-iteration and any wait will be abandonned.  It is usually a bad
idea to close a g-meeting object on which this procedure is waiting
where this procedure is selecting on more than one g-meeting object.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-g_002dmeeting_002dreceive">Scheme Procedure: <strong>g-meeting-receive</strong> <em>await resume m0 [m1 ...]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This receives a datum from a sender via one or more g-meeting objects
&rsquo;m0 m1 ...&rsquo;.  If no sender is waiting to pass the datum, this
procedure waits until a sender calls g-meeting-send on one of the
g-meeting objects to provide the datum.  If a sender is already
waiting, this procedure returns immediately with the datum supplied.
</p>
<p>This procedure is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).
</p>
<p>Multiple receivers may wait on a g-meeting object to permit fan out.
The waiting receivers will be released (as and when a sender provides
a datum) in the order in which this procedure was invoked.  In
addition, this procedure has &rsquo;select&rsquo;-like behavior: multiple
g-meeting objects may be passed and this procedure will receive from
the first one which sends a datum.
</p>
<p>Once a datum exchange has taken place, the g-meeting object(s) can be
reused for making another exchange (provided the g-meeting objects
have not been closed).
</p>
<p>This procedure must be called in the native OS thread in which the
default glib main loop runs.  To have other native OS threads
communicate with that loop, use await-g-task-in-thread,
await-g-generator-in-thread, await-g-task-in-thread-pool or
await-g-generator-in-thread-pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure always returns the datum value supplied by
g-meeting-send unless g-meeting-close has been applied to a g-meeting
object, in which case &rsquo;stop-iteration is returned.  Note that if
multiple g-meeting objects are passed to this procedure and one of
them is then closed, this procedure will return &rsquo;stop-iteration and
any wait will be abandonned.  It is usually a bad idea to close a
g-meeting object on which this procedure is waiting where this
procedure is selecting on more than one g-meeting object.
