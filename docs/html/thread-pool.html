<h4 class="node-heading">thread pool</h4>

<p>This (a-sync thread-pool) module supplements the <a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  (a-sync event-loop) provides
asynchronous procedures which can wait on the completion of a task
running in a worker thread or on an event loop running in another
thread.  However, sometimes it is better to run tasks in a thread pool
rather than launching worker threads, particularly where the workload
suits having the number of threads in the thread pool approximating to
the number of local processors available to the program.  (In guile,
the number of processors so available can be obtained using the
current-processor-count procedure.)
</p>
<p>This (a-sync thread-pool) module provides such a thread pool, together
with two asynchronous procedures (await-task-in-thread-pool! and
await-generator-in-thread-pool!) which can wait in an event loop for a
task on the thread pool to complete and provide its result.
</p>
<p>The thread pool objects provided by this module do not make provision
for rate limiting similar to that provided by the event loops in the
<a href="event-loop.html">(a-sync event-loop)</a> module.  This is because there
is no one-size-fits-all way of doing so.  One common approach is, as
in the case of the event loops provided by this library, to apply
throttling to threads which add tasks by enforcing a wait in their
thread of execution when the level of queued tasks reaches too high a
level, so hindering their ability to add new ones.  However this is
counter productive where it is a task running on the thread pool which
is adding the new tasks, particularly with a thread pool having only a
few threads running in its pool.  Another approach is to throw an
exception when adding tasks which exceed a user-selectable level.
</p>
<p>The best approach is for user code to provide its own rate limiting in
cases where the way that that code is organised means that it could
produce an excessive number of accumulating unexecuted tasks in the
thread pool, possibly by applying delays when unexecuted tasks rise in
number excessively, using timeouts with an event loop. This may be
checked for by having code call the thread-pool-get-num-tasks
procedure before adding a significant batch of new tasks in order to
test queue size, and if necessary postpone adding the new tasks until
the size of the already accumulated tasks has reduced.
</p>
<p>This module provides the following procedures:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002dthread_002dpool">Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-thread-pool</strong> <em>#:key max-threads min-threads idle non-blocking</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure constructs a thread pool object of native OS threads.
It takes four optional arguments.  The #:max-thread keyname specifies
the maximum number of threads which will run in the pool, and the
default value is 8.  The #:min-threads keyname specifies the minimum
number of persistent threads which will run in the pool and will not
be subject to an #:idle timeout, and the default value is 0.  It is an
error if #:min-threads is greater than #:max-threads.
</p>
<p>Thread pool objects with a #:min-threads setting of greater than 0 are
usually best kept as top level objects, because the minimum value of
threads will keep alive in the pool until thread-pool-stop! is called.
If such a thread pool is constructed within a local lexical scope,
then either thread-pool-stop! must be applied to the pool before that
scope is exited, or the last task added to the pool should itself
apply thread-pool-stop! to the pool (which it can do if &rsquo;non-blocking&rsquo;
is #t).  Otherwise, the minimum value of threads will remain alive
uselessly in blocked condition in the pool until the program
terminates, even though the pool may be inaccessible.
</p>
<p>The #:idle keyname specifies the length of time in milliseconds that
threads greater in number than #:min-threads and not executing any
tasks will remain in existence.  The default is 5000 (5 seconds).
</p>
<p>The #:non-blocking keyname affects the operation of the
thread-pool-stop! procedure.  When set to #f, which is the default,
that procedure will not return until all tasks previously added to the
pool have completed.  If set to #t, the thread-pool-stop! procedure
will return immediately, before all tasks have finished.
</p>
<p>The #:max-threads, #:non-blocking and #:idle settings may subsequently
be altered by applying the thread-pool-change-max-threads!,
thread-pool-set-non-blocking! or thread-pool-set-idle-time! procedure
to the pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure will throw an exception if the system is unable to
start the number of threads given as the #:min-threads argument.  In
such a case, any threads which have in fact started in the pool will
be killed.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_003f">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool?</strong> <em>obj</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure indicates whether &rsquo;obj&rsquo; is a thread pool object
constructed by make-thread-pool.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dnum_002dtasks">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-num-tasks</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the number of tasks which the thread pool
object is at present either running in the pool or has queued for
execution.  This procedure will not throw.  It is also thread safe,
although it accesses the task number field outside the pool mutex and
therefore with relaxed memory ordering.  That enables this procedure
to be applied more efficiently for rate limiting purposes but the
result might at any one time be marginally out of date.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dnum_002dthreads">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-num-threads</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the number of threads currently running in the
thread pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dget_002dmax_002dthreads">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-get-max-threads</strong> <em>pool</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure returns the current maximum number of threads set for
the thread pool.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dchange_002dmax_002dthreads_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-change-max-threads!</strong> <em>pool delta</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure will increase, or if &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is negative reduce, the
maximum number of threads which the thread pool object will currently
run by the value of &rsquo;delta&rsquo;.  The main purpose of this is to enable a
task to increment the maximum thread number where it is about to enter
a call which may block (non-asynchronously) for some time, with a view
to decrementing it later when it has finished making blocking calls,
so as to enable another thread to keep a core active.  A
with-thread-pool-increment macro is available which will do this for
you automatically in an exception-safe way (see the documentation on
that macro below).
</p>
<p>If &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is negative and results in a max-threads value of less than
the current number of running threads, the number of threads actually
running will only be reduced as tasks complete, or as idle timeouts
expire.  The maximum number of threads will not be reduced by this
procedure below the min-threads value, or if that value is 0, below 1.
</p>
<p>This procedure does nothing if thread-pool-stop!  has previously been
called.  This procedure is thread safe - any thread may call it.
</p>
<p>If &rsquo;delta&rsquo; is positive and tasks are currently queued for execution, a
new thread or threads will be started for the queued tasks.  This
procedure may therefore throw an exception if the system is unable to
start the required new thread(s).  Because starting new threads can be
time consuming, to minimize contention new threads are started outside
the pool&rsquo;s mutex, although internal book-keeping is done within the
mutex.  One consequence is that if such an exception is thrown while
another thread has concurrently tried to reduce the size of the pool,
the number of threads running in the pool may be smaller than it was
when this procedure was called.  Where min-threads is 0, in certain
circumstances after an exception where no new threads can be started,
the pool could have no running threads in it (so that
thread-pool-get-num-threads returns 0) even though some tasks
previously added to the pool remain pending.  If the system can start
no new threads even though none are running in the pool, it will be
significantly broken so it is not usually worth troubling about this -
the program is doomed in that event whatever.  However if that is
wrong and the cause of the failure to start any threads can be
addressed, then the thread pool can be brought back into use by
calling this procedure again with a positive value (which can be
preceded by a call with a negative value to prevent too many threads
trying to start).

</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it).
</p>
<p>This procedure will throw a compound &amp;thread-pool-error exception
(also incorporating &amp;origin and &amp;message objects) if it is invoked

wait until all the tasks still to execute have finished before
returning, and if #t it will return straight away.
</p>
<p>After this procedure has been called, any attempt to add further tasks
with the thread-pool-add! procedure will fail, and that procedure will
throw a compound &amp;thread-pool-error exception (also incorporating
&amp;origin and &amp;message objects).  The same exception will be thrown if
this procedure is applied to a thread pool to which this procedure has
previously been applied.
</p>
<p>This procedure is thread safe (any thread may call it) unless the
non-blocking setting is #f, in which case no task running on the

<dl>
<dt id="index-thread_002dpool_002dadd_0021">Scheme Procedure: <strong>thread-pool-add!</strong> <em>pool task [fail-handler]</em></dt>
<dd><p>This procedure adds a new task to the thread pool.  &rsquo;task&rsquo; must be a
thunk.  If one or more threads in the pool are currently blocking and
waiting for a task, then the task will begin executing immediately in
one of the threads.  If not, and the number of threads running in the
pool is less than the value returned by thread-pool-get-max-threads, a
new thread will start and the task will execute immediately in the new
thread.  Otherwise, the task will be queued for execution as soon as a
thread becomes available. Tasks will begin execution in the order in
which they are added to the thread pool object.  This procedure is
thread safe (any thread may call it, including any task running on the
thread pool object).
</p>
<p>An optional handler procedure may be passed to &rsquo;fail-handler&rsquo; which
will be invoked if the task throws an exception.  The &rsquo;fail-handler&rsquo;
procedure will be passed the exception object which was thrown.  If a
task throws an exception and no handler procedure is provided, the
program will terminate.
</p>
<p>If this procedure starts a new thread (see above), it may throw an
exception if the system is unable to start the thread correctly, and
if it does so the task will not be added.  This procedure will throw a
compound &amp;thread-pool-error exception (also incorporating &amp;origin and
&amp;message objects) if it is invoked after the thread pool object
concerned has been closed by a call to thread-pool-stop!.

<dt id="index-with_002dthread_002dpool_002dincrement">Syntax: <strong>with-thread-pool-increment</strong> <em>pool body0 body1 ...</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro is intended to be called by a task running on a thread pool
which is about to make a blocking (non-asynchronous) call.  It will
increment the max-threads value of &rsquo;pool&rsquo; by 1 (by calling
thread-pool-change-max-threads!) so as to enable a queued task to keep
a core active, and decrement it again when execution of the body
clauses has completed.
</p>
<p>The (i) increment, (ii) execution of body clauses, and (iii)
decrement, form the three branches of a dynamic-wind, so the decrement
automatically occurs if control leaves body execution because of an
exception or other jump.

<dd><p>The &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument is optional.  The procedure will run &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; in
the thread pool specified by the &rsquo;pool&rsquo; argument.  The result of
executing &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; will then be posted to the event loop specified by
the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or to the default event loop if no &rsquo;loop&rsquo;
argument is provided or if #f is provided as the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument
(pattern matching is used to detect the type of the third argument),
and will comprise this procedure&rsquo;s return value.  This procedure is
intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync
(which supplies the &rsquo;await&rsquo; and &rsquo;resume&rsquo; arguments).  It will normally
be necessary to call event-loop-block! on &rsquo;loop&rsquo; (or on the default
event loop) before invoking this procedure.
</p>
<p>If the optional &rsquo;handler&rsquo; argument is provided, then that handler will
run if &rsquo;thunk&rsquo; throws, and the return value of the handler would
become the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of &rsquo;thunk&rsquo;.
&rsquo;handler&rsquo; should take a single argument, which will be the thrown
exception object.  Note that unlike a handler passed to the
thread-pool-add! procedure, &rsquo;handler&rsquo; will run in the event loop
thread and not in a thread pool thread.  Exceptions thrown by the
handler procedure will propagate out of event-loop-run! for the &rsquo;loop&rsquo;

</p>
<p>This procedure calls &rsquo;await&rsquo; and must (like the a-sync procedure) be
called in the same thread as that in which the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; or default event
loop runs (as the case may be).
</p>
<p>This procedure calls event-post! in the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; or default event loop,
which could be subject to throttling (see the documentation for the
make-event-loop procedure for further information).
</p>
<p>Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up, which shouldn&rsquo;t happen unless the thread pool given by the
&rsquo;pool&rsquo; argument has been closed (in which case a compound
&amp;thread-pool-error exception, also incorporating &amp;origin and &amp;message
objects, will arise), the thread pool tries to start an additional
native thread which the operating system fails to supply (which would
cause a system exception to arise) or memory is exhausted.

<dd><p>The loop argument is optional.  The &rsquo;generator&rsquo; argument is a

documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further details).
This await-generator-in-thread-pool! procedure will cause &rsquo;generator&rsquo;
to run as a task in the &rsquo;pool&rsquo; thread pool, and whenever &rsquo;generator&rsquo;
yields a value this will cause &rsquo;proc&rsquo; to execute in the event loop
specified by the &rsquo;loop&rsquo; argument, or in the default event loop if no
