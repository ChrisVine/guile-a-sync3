When using the scheme (gnome gtk) bindings of guile-gnome with guile,
in order to provide await semantics on gtk+ callbacks it will normally
be necessary to use the 'await' and 'resume' procedures provided by
the a-sync procedure in the @ref{coroutines,,(a-sync coroutines)}
module directly (calling 'resume' in the gtk+ callback when ready, and
waiting on that callback using 'await').  However when launching
timeouts, file watches or idle events on the glib main loop,
convenience procedures are possible similar to those provided for the
event loop in the @ref{event loop,,(a-sync event-loop)} module.  These
are set out below.

Note that the g-idle-add procedure in guile-gnome is suspect - there
appears to be a garbage collection issue, and if you call the
procedure often enough in a single or multi-threaded program it will
eventually segfault.  g-io-add-watch is also broken in guile-gnome, so
this library uses its own glib-add-watch procedure which is exported
publicly in case it is useful to users.  In consequence, consider
using the support for g-golf and guile-gi which is provided by
guile-a-sync3 instead.

Most of the scheme files provided by this library are by default
compiled by this library to bytecode.  That is not the case with this
module, so as not to create a hard dependency on guile-gnome.

Including this module will automatically enable suspendable ports in
order to support the await-glib-read-suspendable,
await-glib-write-suspendable and await-glib-getline procedures.  To
disable suspendable ports again, uninstall-suspendable-ports! can be
called, but this means that those procedures can no longer be used
while suspendable ports are disabled.  In addition, any port using
those procedures must be made non-blocking using fcntl as follows:

@example
(fcntl [port] F_SETFL (logior O_NONBLOCK
                      (fcntl [port] F_GETFL)))
@end example

The (a-sync gnome-glib) module provides the following procedures:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-task-in-thread await resume thunk [handler]
This is a convenience procedure which will run 'thunk' in its own
thread, and then post an event to the default glib main loop when
'thunk' has finished.  This procedure calls 'await' in the default
glib main loop and will return the thunk's return value.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  If
the optional 'handler' argument is provided, then it will be run in
the default glib main loop if 'thunk' throws and its return value will
be the return value of this procedure; otherwise the program will
terminate if an unhandled exception propagates out of 'thunk'.
'handler' should take a single argument, which will be the thrown
exception object.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs, where the
result of calling 'thunk' will be received.  As mentioned above, the
thunk itself will run in its own thread.

Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn't
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the task, if not caught by a
handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-task-in-thread:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (simple-format #t "1 + 1 is ~A\n"
			 (await-glib-task-in-thread await resume
						    (lambda ()
						      (+ 1 1))))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-task await resume thunk
This is a convenience procedure for use with glib, which will run
'thunk' in the default glib main loop.  This procedure calls 'await'
and will return the thunk's return value.  It is intended to be called
in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync.  It is the single-threaded
corollary of await-glib-task-in-thread.  This means that (unlike with
await-glib-task-in-thread) while 'thunk' is running other events in
the main loop will not make progress, so blocking calls should not be
made in 'thunk'.

When 'thunk' is executed, this procedure is waiting on 'await', so
'await' and 'resume' cannot be used again in 'thunk' (although 'thunk'
can call a-sync to start another series of asynchronous operations
with a new await-resume pair).  For that reason, await-glib-yield is
usually more convenient for composing asynchronous tasks.  In
retrospect, this procedure offers little over await-glib-yield, apart
from symmetry with await-glib-task-in-thread.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.

Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the task starts), which shouldn't happen
unless memory is exhausted.  Exceptions arising during execution of
the task, if not caught locally, will propagate out of
g-main-loop-run.

This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-task:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (simple-format #t "1 + 1 is ~A\n"
			 (await-glib-task await resume
					  (lambda ()
					    (+ 1 1))))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-yield await resume
This is a convenience procedure for use with glib, which will
surrender execution to the default glib main loop, so that code in
other a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks can run.  The remainder of the
code after the call to await-glib-yield in the current a-sync or
compose-a-sync block will execute on the next iteration through the
loop.  It is intended to be called within a waitable procedure invoked
by a-sync (which supplies the 'await' and 'resume' arguments).  It's
effect is similar to calling await-glib-task with a task that does
nothing.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.

This procedure should not throw any exceptions unless memory is
exhausted.

This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-yield:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (display "In first iteration through event loop\n")
	  (await-glib-yield await resume)
	  (display "In next iteration through event loop\n")))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-generator-in-thread await resume generator proc [handler]
This is a convenience procedure for acting asynchronously on values
yielded by generator procedures.  The 'generator' argument is a
procedure taking one argument, namely a yield argument (see the
documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further details).
This await-glib-generator-in-thread procedure will run 'generator' in
its own worker thread, and whenever 'generator' yields a value will
cause 'proc' to execute in the default glib main loop.

'proc' should be a procedure taking a single argument, namely the
value yielded by the generator.  If the optional 'handler' argument is
provided, then that handler will be run in the default glib main loop
if 'generator' throws; otherwise the program will terminate if an
unhandled exception propagates out of 'generator'.  'handler' should
take a single argument, which will be the thrown exception object.

This procedure calls 'await' and will return when the generator has
finished or, if 'handler' is provided, upon the generator throwing an
exception.  This procedure will return #f if the generator completes
normally, or 'guile-a-sync-thread-error if the generator throws an
exception and 'handler' is run (the 'guile-a-sync-thread-error symbol
is reserved to the implementation and should not be yielded by the
generator).

This procedure is intended to be called in a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync.  It must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in
the same thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.  As
mentioned above, the generator itself will run in its own thread.

Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the worker thread starts), which shouldn't
happen unless memory is exhausted or pthread has run out of resources.
Exceptions arising during execution of the generator, if not caught by
a handler procedure, will terminate the program.  Exceptions thrown by
the handler procedure will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.
Exceptions thrown by 'proc', if not caught locally, will also
propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-generator-in-thread:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (await-glib-generator-in-thread await resume
					  (lambda (yield)
					    (let loop ((count 0))
					      (when (< count 5)
						(yield (* 2 count))
						(loop (1+ count)))))
					  (lambda (val)
					    (display val)
					    (newline)))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-generator await resume generator proc
This is a convenience procedure for acting asynchronously on values
yielded by generator procedures.  The 'generator' argument is a
procedure taking one argument, namely a yield argument (see the
documentation on the make-iterator procedure for further details).
This await-glib-generator procedure will run 'generator', and whenever
'generator' yields a value will cause 'proc' to execute in the default
glib main loop - each time 'proc' runs it will do so as a separate
event in the main loop and so be multi-plexed with other events.
'proc' should be a procedure taking a single argument, namely the
value yielded by the generator.

This procedure is intended to be called in a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync.  It is the single-threaded corollary of
await-glib-generator-in-thread.  This means that (unlike with
await-glib-generator-in-thread) while 'generator' is running other
events in the main loop will not make progress, so blocking calls
(other than to the yield procedure) should not be made in
'generator'.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.

When 'proc' executes, 'await' and 'resume' will still be in use by
this procedure, so they may not be reused by 'proc' (even though
'proc' runs in the event loop thread).

Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the task starts), which shouldn't happen
unless memory is exhausted.  Exceptions arising during execution of
the generator, if not caught locally, will propagate out of
await-glib-generator.  Exceptions thrown by 'proc', if not caught
locally, will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

This procedure uses g-idle-add: see the introductory remarks about
that.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-generator:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (await-glib-generator await resume
				(lambda (yield)
				  (let loop ((count 0))
				    (when (< count 5)
				      (yield (* 2 count))
				      (loop (1+ count)))))
				(lambda (val)
				  (display val)
				  (newline)))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-timeout await resume msecs thunk
This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will run 'thunk' in the default glib main loop when the timeout
expires.  This procedure calls 'await' and will return the thunk's
return value.  It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync.  The timeout is single shot only - as soon as
'thunk' has run once and completed, the timeout will be removed from
the event loop.

In practice, calling await-glib-sleep may often be more convenient for
composing asynchronous code than using this procedure.  That is
because, when 'thunk' is executed, this procedure is waiting on
'await', so 'await' and 'resume' cannot be used again in 'thunk'
(although 'thunk' can call a-sync to start another series of
asynchronous operations with a new await-resume pair).  In retrospect,
this procedure offers little over await-glib-sleep.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.

Exceptions may propagate out of this procedure if they arise while
setting up (that is, before the first call to 'await' is made), which
shouldn't happen unless memory is exhausted.  Exceptions thrown by
'thunk', if not caught locally, will propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-timeout:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (simple-format #t
			 "Timeout ~A\n"
			 (await-glib-timeout await resume
					     100
					     (lambda ()
					       "expired")))
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-sleep await resume msecs
This is a convenience procedure for use with a glib main loop, which
will suspend execution of code in the current a-sync or compose-a-sync
block for the duration of 'msecs' milliseconds.  The event loop will
not be blocked by the sleep - instead any other events in the event
loop (including any other a-sync or compose-a-sync blocks) will be
serviced.  It is intended to be called within a waitable procedure
invoked by a-sync (which supplies the 'await' and 'resume' arguments).

Calling this procedure is equivalent to calling await-glib-timeout
with a 'proc' argument comprising a lambda expression that does
nothing.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.

This procedure should not throw any exceptions unless memory is
exhausted.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-sleep:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
	  (display "Entering sleep\n")
	  (await-glib-sleep await resume 500)
	  (display "Timeout expired\n")
	  (g-main-loop-quit main-loop)))
(g-main-loop-run main-loop)

@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} glib-add-watch ioc cond func [context]
This procedure replaces guile-gnome's g-io-add-watch procedure, which
won't compile.  It attaches a watch on a g-io-channel object to the
main context provided, or if none is provided, to the default glib
main context (the main program loop).  It returns a glib ID which can
be passed subsequently to the g-source-remove procedure.  It should be
possible to call this procedure in any thread.

'ioc' is the g-io-condition object to which the watch is to be
attached, and 'cond' is a list of symbols (being 'in, 'out, 'pri,
'hup, 'err and 'nval) comprising the events for which the watch is
established.

'func' is executed when an event occurs, and takes two arguments:
first the g-io-channel object to which the watch has been attached,
and second a g-io-condition object indicating the watch condition
which has been met (note: the interface for g-io-condition objects is
broken in guile-gnome at present).  The watch is ended either by
'func' returning #f, or by applying g-source-remove to the return
value of this procedure.  Otherwise the watch will continue.

File watches in guile-gnome are implemented using a GIOChannel object,
and unfortunately GIOChannel support in guile-gnome is decaying.  The
only procedure that guile-gnome provides to read from a GIOChannel
object is g-io-channel-read-line, which does not work.  One is
therefore usually left with having to read from a guile port (whose
underlying file descriptor is 'fd') using guile's port input
procedures, but this has its own difficulties, which means that one of
the following approaches should be adopted (i) the port has to be
unbuffered (say by using the open-file or fdopen procedure with the
'0' mode option or the R6RS open-file-input-port procedure with a
buffer-mode of none, or by calling setvbuf), or (ii) 'proc' must deal
with everything in the port's buffer by calling drain-input, or by
looping on char-ready? before returning, or (iii) the port's ordinary
input procedures should be used with suspendable ports using the
await-glib-read-suspendable procedure.  This is because otherwise, if
the port is buffered, once the port is read from there may be further
characters in the buffer to be dealt with even though the GIOChannel
watch does not trigger because there is nothing new to make the file
descriptor ready for reading.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-read-suspendable await resume port proc
'proc' is a procedure taking a single argument, to which the port will
be passed when it is invoked.  The purpose of 'proc' is to carry out
i/o operations on 'port' using the port's normal read procedures.
'port' must be a suspendable non-blocking port.  This procedure will
return when 'proc' returns, as if by blocking read operations, with
the value returned by 'proc'.  However, the glib main loop will not be
blocked by this procedure even if only individual characters or bytes
comprising part characters are available at any one time.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which
supplies the 'await' and 'resume' arguments).  'proc' must not itself
explicitly apply 'await' and 'resume' as those are potentially in use
by the suspendable port while 'proc' is executing.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same
thread as that in which the default glib main loop runs.

Exceptions (say, from 'proc' because of port or conversion errors)
will propagate out of this procedure in the first instance, and if not
caught locally will then propagate out of g-main-loop-run.

This procedure will not call 'await' if the read operation(s) in
'proc' can be effected immediately without waiting: instead, after
reading this procedure would return straight away without invoking the
glib main loop.

As an example of how to use await-glib-read-suspendable, here is the
implementation of await-glib-getline:

@example
(define (await-glib-getline await resume port)
  (await-glib-read-suspendable await resume port
			       (lambda (p)
				 (read-line p))))
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-getline await resume port
This procedure is provided mainly to retain compatibility with the
guile-a-sync library for guile-2.0, because it is trivial to implement
with await-glib-read-suspendable (and is implemented by
await-glib-read-suspendable).

It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync,
and reads a line of text from a non-blocking suspendable port and
returns it (without the terminating '\n' character).  See the
documentation on the await-glib-read-suspendable procedure for further
particulars about this procedure.

Here is an example of the use of await-glib-getline:
@example
(define main-loop (g-main-loop-new #f #f))
(a-sync (lambda (await resume)
          (display "Enter a line of text at the keyboard\n")

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-getblock await resume port size
This procedure is provided mainly to retain compatibility with the
guile-a-sync library for guile-2.0, because an implementation is
trivial to implement with await-glib-read-suspendable (and is
implemented by await-glib-read-suspendable).

It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync,
and reads a block of data, such as a binary record, of size 'size'
from a non-blocking suspendable port 'port'.  This procedure and will
return a pair, normally comprising as its car a bytevector of length
'size' containing the data, and as its cdr the number of bytes
received and placed in the bytevector (which will be the same as
'size' unless an end-of-file object was encountered part way through
receiving the data).  If an end-of-file object is encountered without
any bytes of data, a pair with eof-object as car and #f as cdr will be
returned.

See the documentation on the await-glib-read-suspendable procedure for
further particulars about this procedure.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} await-glib-write-suspendable await resume port proc
'proc' is a procedure taking a single argument, to which the port will
be passed when it is invoked.  The purpose of 'proc' is to carry out
i/o operations on 'port' using the port's normal write procedures.
'port' must be a suspendable non-blocking port.  This procedure will
return when 'proc' returns, as if by blocking write operations, with
the value returned by 'proc'.  However, the glib main loop will not be
blocked by this procedure even if only individual characters or bytes
comprising part characters can be written at any one time.  It is
intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync (which
supplies the 'await' and 'resume' arguments).  'proc' must not itself
explicitly apply 'await' and 'resume' as those are potentially in use
by the suspendable port while 'proc' is executing.

This procedure must (like the a-sync procedure) be called in the same

This procedure will not call 'await' if the write operation(s) in
'proc' can be effected immediately without waiting: instead, after
writing this procedure would return straight away without invoking the
glib main loop.

As an example of how to use await-glib-write-suspendable, here is the
implementation of await-glib-put-string:

@example
(define (await-glib-put-string await resume port text)
  (await-glib-write-suspendable await resume port
				(lambda (p)
				  (put-string p text)
				  ;; enforce a flush when the current

await-glib-write-suspendable).

It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync,
and will write a bytevector to the port.

See the documentation on the await-glib-write-suspendable procedure

As mentioned in relation to the await-glib-write-suspendable
procedure, write exceptions will propagate out of this procedure in
the first instance, and if not caught locally (say by placing a catch

It is intended to be called in a waitable procedure invoked by a-sync,

If CR-LF line endings are to be written when outputting the string,
the '\r' character (as well as the '\n' character) must be embedded in
the string.

See the documentation on the await-glib-write-suspendable procedure
